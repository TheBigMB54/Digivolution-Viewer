    <div class="description">
     <strong>Perequisites?</strong> Must have a Digimon vulnerable to the cold (noted
                           below*); you can also read Shellmon's bulletin
                           board article about a hero in Freezeland, but it's
                           probably not necessary.
                         * - Any Baby or In-Training Digimon;
                           - Agumon or Kunemon;
                           - Greymon, Meramon, Monochromon, Centarumon,
                             Tyrannomon, Kuwagamon or Kabuterimon.</br>
     <strong>How?</strong> Bring your cold-weak partner to the largest screen in Freezeland
            (the one you land in if you use the Birdra Transport) and let
            your Digimon get sick from the cold; if you have a Moldy Meat,
            Happy Mushroom or DigiSeaBass you can also force your Digimon to
            be sick to speed up the process. Walk around Freezeland until
            your Digimon faints - you need to walk over certain spots to
            activate it - and you will wake up in Frigimon's igloo. After
            talking to him, come back with a partner that is not vulnerable
            to the cold and talk to him again.<br/>
     <strong>What?</strong> Joins the Restaurant.

    <div class="description">
     <strong>How?</strong> Go to the last screen of Freezeland, directly South of Frigimon's
             igloo, and battle him. After being admonished by him, come back
             the next day (or any day after that) between 4pm - 8pm and you
             will have to battle him again, this time without using commands
             or items; Garurumon will start the battle at half HP (or more if
             you return later than agreed). Defeat him in this "fair fight"<br/>

     <strong>Perequisites?</strong> Partner must be a Vaccine Digimon.</br>
     <strong>How?</strong> North-West from the second screen of Freezeland (from Great Canyon)
           there is the Ice Sanctuary. Access it with a strong Vaccine-type
           partner Digimon and move around near the angelic statue to reveal a
           secret passage to the basement. Then find the secret passage in the
           right-hand-side wall of the passageway and enter a room with some
           teleporters; go directly right from where you entered and you will
           arrive in a narrow passage. Defeat the enemies and go through into
           another teleporter room; go into the top-right teleporter to find
           one last room. Avoid the teleporter behind you and defeat the three
           enemies to access a large ball of light. Then enter the teleporter,
           find your way back to the first basement passage, and exit to the
           statue room to find the statue gone. Angemon will appear and talk
           to you, and then join the city.<br/>
     <strong>What?</strong> Upgrades Jijimon's house; also stands next to Jijimon and acts as
           his "recordkeeper", by which I mean he gives you clues on where to
           find more recruitable Digimon.
